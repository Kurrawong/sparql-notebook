# SPARQL Training Live

This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for training in the [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) query language. These notebooks can be run live, online. See the Binder button below.

The content is delivered in a series of modules, the first 4 of which are entirely generic and the 5th - "QALI-specific querying" - uses examples from Queensland's Address Database, _QALI_, but is generic in the concepts conveyed. The QALI database is likely to be delivered online in a form that can be SPARQL queried but queryable data is supplied in the notebook too.

1. Intro to RDF
2. Querying RDF - SPARQL
3. All about SPARQL
4. Extending SPARQL
5. QALI-specific querying

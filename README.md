# SPARQL Training Notebooks

This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks]() for training in the [SPARQL]() query language.

The content is delivered in a series of modules, the first 3 of which are entirely generic and the fourth - "SPARQL In Practice" - is also generic but uses examples from Queensland's Address Database, _QALI_, which is delivered online in a form that can be SPARQL queried.
